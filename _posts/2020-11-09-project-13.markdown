problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
       The idea of applying data analytics for the United States 2020 Presidential Election was sparked when I picked up Qlik Sense, a powerful data visualization tool. “Nothing beats getting your hands dirty.” Even though I am not a very political person, I figure this is a great chance to challenge myself by applying and upskilling my newly honed knowledge. I started my work on 6th November, the third day since Election Day, while the world was much concerned and uncertain about what was going on with this race.</p>
