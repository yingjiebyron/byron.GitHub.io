problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
        At the bedrock of all music recommendation systems is artist similarity. Aside from Spotify, many parties have employed big data in an attempt to link similar artists and songs in order to produce more effective recommendations to consumers, both as an extra benefit to consumers and to maintain interest in consuming more from the service.</p>

    <p align="left">
        In this project, we aimed to explore various tools and parameters in the visualization of artist maps. By experimenting with different tools and parameters, we hope to shed light on the inherent ability of certain settings in drawing useful insights.</p>

implementation: 
    <p align="left">Datasets </p>
        <ul> 
            <li align="left">
                 Much of the analysis was done on the 22,000 songs dataset (3.8GB) on a Hadoop server, a subset which was provided on the Million Songs website.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p align="left">Methods </p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Preprocessed the data using PySpark by feature engineering, one-hot encoding, normalization and genre categorization.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Calculated the cosine similarity and adjusted pearson similarity with the factorized song-artist matrix.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Transformed the raw database into triplets for network graph visualization and used Pyvis, NetworkX and Gephi to visualize the network with interactivity.
            </li> 
        </ul>

    <p align="left">Outcome </p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Identiftied interesting insights of music artistis clustering and geographical distribution by conducting statistical metrics and network analysis.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Provided a solution of continous similartiy computation as compared to the binary similarity provided by the million song dataset, with a decent level of precision and recall result in the validation set.
            </li> 
        </ul>
