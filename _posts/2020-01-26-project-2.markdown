problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
        Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an interesting framework in deep learning to capture the distribution of the training data for generation of new data based on the same distribution. I explored GAN models with different techniques to generate the most photorealistic fake dog images by colour as possible.</p>

implementation: 
    <p align="left">Preprocessing & data augmentation </p>
        <ul> 
            <li align="left">
                Re-categorized the dog images by labelling by color for less conditions and larger sample size.
            </li>
            <li align="left">
                Cropped by bound box to get rid of environmental interferences and enforce more acurate learning for the network.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Transformed the dog images by flipping, rotating and changing pixel colors and balance the colored dogs training dataset to 8000 images each.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p align="left">Models </p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Used Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture as pretrained baseline model and imporved with Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN) as a deeper NN to learn more latent features of a dog's appearance.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Incorporated a Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN) to refine the generated dog image resolution for more photorealistic results. 
        </ul>

    <p align="left">Outcome </p>
        <ul>
            <li align="left">
                Improved over 20% as compared to baseline model in terms of MiFID score evaluation.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                A sigificant increase in image quality in terms of PSNR socre for reconstructing high-resolution images of SRGAN model.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Designed an interactive GUI for on-spot generation of dog images by inputing color labels using pre-trained GAN models.
            </li> 
            <li align="left">
                Some sample generated dog images as shown below
            </li>
        </ul>
