        My interest in Weiqi (GO) was spurred when I came across the news that the first AI machinery Alpha GO developed by Google beated the human world champion Lee Sedol. With my inquisitiveness in AI and exposure to courses like Game Theory and Optimization, I wanted to step into this strategic board game to know more about the theories and rationale behind the story.</p>

        I joined the Go Club where I made friends who are constantly inspiring, smart and helpful. Even though I am still on my way to improve my skills and knowledge in this complex game, I enjoy the learning process and how it inspires me to develop a forward-thinking ideology. It teaches me to think more of things like what's the effect and possibilities of each action. With my continued study in the reinforcement learning topic in AI, I found there is much more to learn about this game and its related frontiers.
