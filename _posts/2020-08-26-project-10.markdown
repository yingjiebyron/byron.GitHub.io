        Muay Thai, or referred to as 'Thai boxing', is a combat sport of Thailand that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. This discipline is known as the "art of eight limbs" as it is characterized by the combined use of fists, elbows, knees, and shins.</p>

        I actively participated in the weekly training sessions with our paid professional coach who was the national winner in this sport. I found the Muay Thai as a martial art help me build up energetic, concentrated spirit and also push my physical and mental limit when I felt almost exhausted.
