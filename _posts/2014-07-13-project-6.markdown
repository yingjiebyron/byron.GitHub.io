problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
        To make relevant products easily discoverable, one fundamental challenge is to accurately extract relevant information from large volume of products. The theme of the National Data Science Challenge 2019 is Product Information Extraction in the Wild - a challenge to extract insightful knowledge from large volumes of textual and visual data using Machine Learning Analytics. The challenge required to determine the category of a product given its image and title. Performance was be evaluated based on the accuracy of the classification results.</p>

implementation: 
    <ul>
        <li align="left">
            Attened a one-week training workshop covering advanced data science topics such as Pytorch and Keras in image classification and deep learning models.
        </li> 
        <li align="left">
            Participated in the challenge in Product Category Classification in a team of 4, aiming to build an image classifier to classify e-commerce products.
        </li>
        <li align="left">
            Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analytics (EDA) to explore the data feature space and insights with over 60,000 data records.
        </li> 
        <li align="left">
            Conducted NLP techniques on the product titles using NLTK packages to weight the words by TF-IDF and word2vec and thereby extracted relevant predictor of products' categories.
        </li> 
        <li align="left">
            Built class-specific classifier by adding biases in logistic regression to guide the classifier to tune weights on specific categories to improved the prediction accuracy.
        </li>
    </ul>
