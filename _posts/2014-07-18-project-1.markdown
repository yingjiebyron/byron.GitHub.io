problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
        With constantly changing business climate and market sentiments, monitoring the financial capabilities of obligors are integral to a bank's operations. Our client conducts regular Earning Warning reviews to analyse data such as financial reports and industry news to assess company performance to determine if it warrants any reassessment of the client’s credit rating. The current EW process requires manual collection of data from various sources that is ultimately still insufficient, especially for private companies, for effective risk analysis. </p>

implementation: 
    <p align="left"> For this project, our team designed syncReact, an integrated system that automatically extracts and presents essential credit signals in a consolidated and timely manner along with insightful data visualisations to facilitate credit analysts’ ongoing credit risk reassessment of their borrowers.</p>
