problem_statement: 
    <p align="left"> 
        Under the initiative and supervisorship of our ESD dean Prof. Jackson, the Undergradute Research Opportunities Programme(UROP) took aim to real-time simulate the fligt aviation data from ASEAN region and connection to other regions and thereby seek optimatization by further analysis.</p>

implementation: 
    <ul>
        <li align="left">
            Crawled flight route data from websites using R and Python to simulate a flight tracking program.
        </li> 
        <li align="left">
            Co-Designed a database to represent flight trajectories including tables for waypoint and airport locations using MySQL Workbench.
        </li>
        <li align="left">
            Formulated algorithms to translate and summarize surveillance data into flight trajectory data.
        </li> 
        <li align="left">
            Wrote web-based interface to visualize trajectories and animate aircraft movements using Javascript on Cesium.
        </li> 
    </ul>
